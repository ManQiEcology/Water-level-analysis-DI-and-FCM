Note: FCM pond data are collected by USGS. Water levels are recorded in feet, referenced to NAVD88.

2. WELL INSTALLATION INFO

File: Well info.txt

This file includes the following fields for each well:
- Well_ID
- S/N
- Well_top_to_logger (cm)
- Well_top_elevation_2019 (m)
- Well_length_above_soil (cm)
- Logger_depth_2019 (cm)
- Soil_surface_elevation_2019 (m)
- Note
- Well_top_elevation_2020 (m)
- Well_height_2020
- Logger_depth_2020 (cm)
- Elevation_2020 (m)

This information is used to calculate logger depth and surface elevation relative to a fixed benchmark.

3. FLOOD TOLERANCE DATA

File: flood tolerance extracted from papers.xls

Structure:
No. | Inundation | Value | Species           | Index                      | Site | Source
----|------------|-------|--------------------|-----------------------------|------|-----------------------------
1   | 7.9815     | -323  | J. roemerianus     | Aboveground biomass change | LOLA | Voss, Christian & Morris (2013)
2   | 24.2556    | -304  | J. roemerianus     | Aboveground biomass change | LOLA | Voss, Christian & Morris (2013)
3   | 48.9922    | -216  | J. roemerianus     | Aboveground biomass change | LOLA | Voss, Christian & Morris (2013)
4   | 52.7793    | -618  | J. roemerianus     | Aboveground biomass change | LOLA | Voss, Christian & Morris (2013)

This file compiles experimental results from literature and is used to assess species-specific responses to inundation stress.

## üíª Code

The `Code/` folder contains all R scripts in the analysis.

Key files include:

- `Water level analysis.R` ‚Äì Script to analyze hydrological regime and output figures
- `flood tolerance.R` ‚Äì Script to plot the flood tolerance curves of marsh plants
- `03_generate_figures.R` ‚Äì Generates plots for publication/report
